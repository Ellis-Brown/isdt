Title: Why can't you rewrite this project in another language?

Comment:
  I have to use this software every day but it is so brittle. I have to make
  sure all of my numbers are properly formatted because your software does not
  handle edge cases in string to number conversions properly! The code quality
  is trash. Come on, `strtol`, really? You should re-write this project in Go
  or Rust, which have better error handling support and better standard
  libraries.

  It's really not that hard. Maybe 10 hours of work. It would make everything
  better. The fact that you haven't done this yet indicates extreme laziness on
  the part of the maintainers. I might just have to fork the project and do it
  myself.
